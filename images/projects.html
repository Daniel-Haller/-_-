    <h1>Java Checkers<br></h1>
    <p width="100">
      This project was designed to apply the coding techniques we’ve learned in our Java class to a practical and functional program. 
      I worked with a team of 2 other students to design and develop a playable game of checkers using Java and JavaFX. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of our project was to develop a stable and working version of checkers, then provide other features based on our knowledge of Java. 
      This highlighted the use of methods and object-oriented programming to simulate actions in checkers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was developed over a couple of months during the covid 19 epidemic which resulting in face to face meetings as a team being prohibited. 
      Considering the fact most if not all of our college studies were moved to an online format, our team had to not only adapt to learning in a new environment, 
      but also collaborating in one as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The features of the project include a completely playable game of checkers with an end screen, restart board screen, and save and load features. 
      The game has no network or online connectivity and is meant to be played on one solo machine. There is also no AI present in the program. 
      Lastly, there’s debug options labeled “God Powers” and a options to change the layout of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, I worked on:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>    
        <li>Designing the GUI and Layout options</li>
        <li>Programming the Timers</li>
        <li>Saving and Loading the program</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the project each of us were learning more about java as the project was being developed.
      This resulted in much of the code being outdated or changed as the semester progressed. 
      I know of some errors in the code that were unable to be resolved before the deadline of our project and I learned a lot in working on this program. 
      If I were to redo this program again, I would make a lot of changes to the initial design, function, and code structure.

      <h1>Data Analysis </h1>
      <p>In my studies one subject I’ve often explored is data analysis through the preprocessing and post processing of data. 
        Currently I’ve done 2 different semester-long projects that fall under this category:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>   
            <li> Speech Recognition AI:</li>
            <div>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Attached is a copy of the final report of our work and the source code on google colab where you can see the bot in action. 
            </div>

            <li>Tornado Prediction:</li> 
              <div>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Attached is a copy of the final report of our work. There is no source code available because the report includes our graphs and results. 
              </div>

              <p>I love to talk about these projects because they were fun and insightful, but both projects speak for themselves pretty well.</p>

                <div>
                  We proposed creating an artificial intelligence agent that would be able to recognize vocal commands from an external source. 
                  The agent would be trained on a set of spoken words, a dict data type with an audio file and a label stating the word spoken. 
                  Once trained, the agent should be able to pick a word from a list of labels that is most similar to the sound given to the agent.

                  In this report we will take our knowledge gained from datamining to apply the research tactics 
                  and organizational techniques to tornado data collected in the United States and through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
                  Through an analysis of the data, we can search for correlations between the different tornado attributes and develop classifiers 
                  that can predict further attributes of tornadoes given our data.

              A Highschool project retelling the events of the final act of Beowulf. 
              Filmed and edited in the span of a week, it was a relic of its time. 
              It was made in the span of a week on a free editing software and a green sheet held up by clamps in the basement of my parent’s house. 
              This project helped inspire my creativity and structural skills to put together a finished project, and although the video isn’t perfect in my eyes, 
              it was a memorable moment in my life that helped me develop my creativity.

              My duties in this project included scriptwriting, group organization, filming, set building, lighting, gathering equipment, and editing.

      <h1>HTML Pages</h1>
      <p>HTML and JavaScript were some of the first programming languages I worked in and therefore have a soft spot in my heart for housing some of my earliest programs. 
        The language is very versatile in many aspects, and I still recommend it for those looking for a place to start. 
      </p>

        Here are some webpages I programmed that I find significant of presenting despite them being from a time when I had not yet developed many skills and techniques of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the purpose of these websites was not to create aesthetically pleasing webpages, but rather to use math, logic, and problem solving to complete a task.

    <h1>Java Checkers<br></h1>
    <p width="100">
      This project was designed to apply the coding techniques we’ve learned in our Java class to a practical and functional program. 
      I worked with a team of 2 other students to design and develop a playable game of checkers using Java and JavaFX. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of our project was to develop a stable and working version of checkers, then provide other features based on our knowledge of Java. 
      This highlighted the use of methods and object-oriented programming to simulate actions in checkers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was developed over a couple of months during the covid 19 epidemic which resulting in face to face meetings as a team being prohibited. 
      Considering the fact most if not all of our college studies were moved to an online format, our team had to not only adapt to learning in a new environment, 
      but also collaborating in one as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The features of the project include a completely playable game of checkers with an end screen, restart board screen, and save and load features. 
      The game has no network or online connectivity and is meant to be played on one solo machine. There is also no AI present in the program. 
      Lastly, there’s debug options labeled “God Powers” and a options to change the layout of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, I worked on:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>    
        <li>Designing the GUI and Layout options</li>
        <li>Programming the Timers</li>
        <li>Saving and Loading the program</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the project each of us were learning more about java as the project was being developed.
      This resulted in much of the code being outdated or changed as the semester progressed. 
      I know of some errors in the code that were unable to be resolved before the deadline of our project and I learned a lot in working on this program. 
      If I were to redo this program again, I would make a lot of changes to the initial design, function, and code structure.

      <h1>Data Analysis </h1>
      <p>In my studies one subject I’ve often explored is data analysis through the preprocessing and post processing of data. 
        Currently I’ve done 2 different semester-long projects that fall under this category:</p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Attached is a copy of the final report of our work. There is no source code available because the report includes our graphs and results. 
              </div>

                  We proposed creating an artificial intelligence agent that would be able to recognize vocal commands from an external source. 
                  The agent would be trained on a set of spoken words, a dict data type with an audio file and a label stating the word spoken. 
                  Once trained, the agent should be able to pick a word from a list of labels that is most similar to the sound given to the agent.

                  Through an analysis of the data, we can search for correlations between the different tornado attributes and develop classifiers 
                  that can predict further attributes of tornadoes given our data.

    <h2>3D Models</h2>

    <div class="w3-large">
      While working on projects like Grimalkin and Keirnel’s Quest, I found an interest in the process of 3D modeling. 
      This includes designing, uv mapping, rigging, and animating models to present them in games and other medias. 
      I’ve developed my skills rapidly with each project and am curious how far I can push these skills in the future.
    </div><br>

    <div class="w3-large">
      The models below are designed to be low poly and be simple in design but impactful in their environment. 
      The games I’ve worked on revolve around the low poly style presented 
      which allows for less focus on making detailed art and allowing more time to go into other aspects of the project since the teams are often small. 
      I’m super proud of all of the models I’ve made and have even more fun rigging and animating them.

        <div>I trained a LoRA to generate the character Banette from the Pokémon franchise. 
          I did this because I wanted to learn more about the process of training, and because Banette is my favorite Pokémon.

      <h2>Photo Generation using Stable Diffusion</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve always been interested in AI generated photos and how they work. 
          This project helped me connect how an AI can train off of an image-set and manipulating that dataset can affect the final product. 
          Stable Diffusion is an open source image generation model that uses deep learning to turn text based prompts into images. 
          It uses a variety of models trained off of different image-sets, and has tons of flexibilities to allow for even more customization of the images. 
          One of these extension is a LoRA which stands for “Low-Rank Adaptation”. 
          The goal of a LoRA is further train a model for a more specific task instead of generating images for multiple possible situations. 
          I trained a LoRA to generate the character Banette from the Pokémon franchise. 
          I did this because I wanted to learn more about the process of training, and because Banette is my favorite Pokémon. 
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          To run this LoRA file, you need a way to run stable diffusion. 
          If you want to run it locally on your computer, I recommend using 
          <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui" target="_blank">stable-diffusion-WebUI</a>
          and getting the model 
          <a href="https://civitai.com/models/95655/purrfectmergev1" target="_blank">PurrfectMerge_v1.</a>
          Other models will work, but this is the main model I used for testing. 
        </p>
        <div>
          Otherwise, there's many online stable diffusion sites that allow for LoRA integration. The main one I use and enjoy is 
          <a href="https://dezgo.com/txt2img"  target="_blank">https://dezgo.com</a>. 
          On that site, click more options and follow the instructions for adding a LoRA, there’s a couple models that work on the site so if you have some time to kill go wild.

        <div>My second LoRA that generates rabbitlike creatures (named mimiga) from the game Cave Story. 
          This project took what I learned from the previous LoRA and went a step further in creating a LoRA that could resemble a 
          more diverse selection of creatures with a far scarcer selection of photos. 
          With this lack of photos, a lot of time and care went into the selection of dataset images as well as assuring they were appropriately tagged.

          After learning a lot in creating the Banette LoRA, 
          I decided to try my hands at creating a LoRA based off of a character with a lot more variance. 
          This lead me to creating a LoRA based around the mimiga creature from the video game Cave Story. 
          Overall, Mimiga have a lot more variance in the way they look, and I wanted to try and capture the different features present in the different characters in the game.
